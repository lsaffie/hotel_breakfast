Story: Admin user editing menus

  As admin 
  I want to edit the menu list
  So that I can add and remove menus from the site
  
  Scenario: An admin adds a menu that does not already exist
    Given no menu named 'Breakfast' exists
    
    When admin goes to menus
    And clicks on 'New menu'
    And fills in menu[name] with 'Breakfast'
    And clicks the Create button
    
    Then a menu named 'Breakfast' should exist
    And the admin should see the menu show page
    And page should have the menu's name
